                    <p>Hi, I'm Ajinkya {pronounced as Ah-gink-Ya}, I build data driven products and decision systems for Shipt inc. </p>

                    <p>At Shipt, I work on anomaly detection systems monitoring critical business metrics. Build vector representation for Shipt's product catalog serving as input to several data science jobs. I contribute to Shipt's internal data science tools and libraries for R. As a personal project, I'm working on community detection in purchase habits for product recommendations and reorder patterns. </p>

                    <p>Prior to Shipt, I attended Indiana's Data Science Graduate Program. I graduated with a GPA of 3.6. At Indiana, I was a Research Associate at the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. I worked for Dr. Henshel and Professor Alexander Alexeev. I worked on parameterizibility of cyberarchitectures for intrusion detection and database accessibility. I was part of a dynamic team consisting of Professors and Graduate students from Indiana and University of California at Berkeley. Prior to that, I was as a Teaching Assistant for a course in Artificial Intelligence taught by Dr. Rawlins. I automated code testing and grading for course assignments, mentored multiple groups in their machine learning course projects.</p>

                    <p>I work with R and Python on the job building interesting machine learning approaches to solve business problems. Not one to shy away from the grunt work, I try to help the data engineering, catalog and operations teams at Shipt whenever the opportunity arises. I'm well versed with building dockerized data science jobs, their deployment and monitoring. We follow a strict agile workflow with each job requring thorough integration testing and multiple peer reviews. This practice has improved my abiltity to write production ready codes and control over the git workflow. </p>

                    <p>If you'd like to know more about me please do checkout my Resume, you can always reach me via email. </p>
