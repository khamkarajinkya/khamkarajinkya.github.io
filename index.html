                <p>{Pronounced as Ah-gink-Ya}, I help bring people together using data science at Plenty Of Fish. </p>
                <p>Prior to Plenty Of Fish, I've held Data Science positions at Citeo and Shipt. At Criteo, working as a Senior Machine
                   Learning Engineer on the Retail Media Platform program, I helped build systems that offered popular brands in-depth insight and
                   understanding of their digital marketing campaigns. We automated purchase of retail media space for brands, optimizing
                   their campaign spends to maximize their outreach to the right audience. At Shipt, I worked as a Data Scientist in the search and
                   recommendations space. We mined user signals to identify repeated purchase patterns and behaviors, I built systems that modeled these
                   signals to provide curated list of product recommendations and offers, improve the overall user experience metrics and increase the overall
                   basket size.</p>

                <p>My skillset includes programming in native python, building models in vertex AI and Sagemaker, working with Postgres SQL, BigQuery, Bigtable and Redis databases.
                   Kafka real time streaming information integration.Visualizations using Tableau and Looker. Telemetry using Grafana dashboards and GCP error monitoring logs.
                   My <span class='link'><a href = "Resume.pdf" class='link'>resume</a></span> lists projects I've worked and value I have brought to the various organisations I have worked at.</p>

                <p>I love travelling to new places and immersing in the local culture. I'm equally biased between high rises and deep forests. In my free time, you would find me
                   roaming around the city with my camera in tow. You can check my instagram, I post some of my favourite photos on it</p>
