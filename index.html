                <p>{Pronounced as Ah-gink-Ya}, I help bring people together using data science at Plenty Of Fish. </p>
                <p>Prior to Plenty Of Fish, I've held Data Science & Analytics positions at Citeo and Shipt. At Criteo, working as a Senior Machine
                   Learning Engineer on the Retail Media Platform program, I helped build systems that offered popular brands in-depth insight and
                   understanding of their digital marketing campaigns performance. We automated purchase of retail media space for brands, optimizing
                   their campaign spends to maximize their outreach to the right audience. At Shipt, I worked as a Data Scientist in the search and
                   recommendations space. We mined user signals to identify repeated purchase patterns and behaviors, I built systems that modeled these
                   signals to provide curated list of product recommendations and offers, improve the overall user experience metrics and increase the overall
                   basket size which is a key critical metric for the business</p>

                <p>I work with R and Python on the job building interesting machine learning approaches to solve business problems. I try to help the data engineering, catalog and operations teams at Shipt in their grunt work whenever the opportunity arises. I'm well versed with building dockerized data science jobs, their deployment and monitoring. We follow a strict agile workflow with each job requring thorough integration testing and multiple peer reviews. This practice has improved my abiltity to write production ready codes and control over the git workflow. </p>
