<p>This internship assignment is from September until the end of December 2017. Will you be available to be on-site 40 hours a week?  </p>
<p>Yes, I would be available during that period for the internship</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why are you interested in this position? </p>
<p>This position is in perfect synchronization with my academic background, skill set and my professional goals. The internship involves designing intelligent systems to make data driven decisions, this is a domain I have worked in and I find it very exciting. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What level of experience do you have with data analysis?  </p>
<p>I have 2 years of programming experience in Data Science with R and python. In this duration, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most popular machine learning and statistical packages. I interned at HoldingWilley cricket website, one of India's most popular cricketing websites as a Data Analyst and I worked as a Research Assistant in Machine Learning at the University of Mumbai. Additionally I have worked on several interesting data science and computer vision projects mentioned below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>
<p>How would you define data science?  </p>
<p>Personally, I believe data science is extracting userful information and insights from a large collection of unstructured and uninformative data to make informed decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Describe a project youâ€™ve completed that required data analysis  </p>
<p>Recently, I worked on the following projects.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Predicting amazon product backorders .  <ul>
<li>The goal of this project was to determine whether a product would go on backorder or not.</li>
<li>There were two major issues with the dataset<ul>
<li>Target classes were imbalanced [98% samples belonged to 'no backorder']</li>
<li>Target classes were inseparable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I achieved 90% accuracy and 85% recall using the following techniques<ul>
<li>Non linear dimension reduction and visualization, support vector machines and gradient boosting ensemble learner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The model was designed in R.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>United States Presidential Elections- predicting voter preference<ul>
<li>The goal of this project was to determine individual's voting preference given his demographic information and his policy alignment.</li>
<li>I designed two ensemble learners, a gradient boosting model and a random forest model. The gradient boosting model achieved 90% accuracy on the test set.</li>
<li>The model was designed in R and the report was designed in Tableau</li>

<ul>
<li>Predicting unemployment rate using long short term memory recurrent neural networks<ul>
<li>The goal of this project was to predict unemployment rate in the United States.</li>
<li>The Gross Domestic Product time series followed an inverse time lagged relationship with the unemployment time series, thus the GDP series was used as the source series.</li>
<li>The model's biggest challenge was to adapt to the inconsistent oscillations in the target series.</li>
<li>My model achieved an RMSE error of less than 0.05 and did an excellent job in following the target series</li>
<li>The model was developed in python using keras deep learning repository with tensorflow backend</li>

<li>In what ways have you worked collaboratively with a team before?</li>
</ul>
<p>During my tenure as a Research Assistant, I worked with 2 fellow researchers. Our work ethic and collaboration lead to the project being completed well before its due date. Additionally, I served as the General Secretary of Computer Society of India, student chapter. Here I had the opportunity to lead a team of 16 people. My responsibilities included looking after the daily activities of the chapter, organizing workshops, assigning work to the fellow members and ensuring the work gets completed. We won the best student chapter award under my leadership and guidance. I am currently leading the Association of Information Science and Technology chapter at Indiana University.</p>
