<p>This internship assignment is from September until the end of December 2017. Will you be available to be on-site 40 hours a week?  </p>
<p>Yes, I would be available during that period for the internship</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Why are you interested in this position? </p>
<p>This position perfectly aligns with my academic background, skill set and my professional goals. The internship involves designing intelligent systems to make data driven decisions and presents responsibilities that I have worked on in the past and have experience in. It also provides me with the opportunities to put my skills to test while learning new ones along the way.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>What level of experience do you have with data analysis?  </p>
<p>I have 2 years of hands-on programming experience in R and python. In this duration, I had the opportunity to work with some of the most popular machine learning and statistical packages. I have interned at HoldingWilley, one of India's most popular cricketing website as a Data Analyst, I have also worked as a Research Assistant in Machine Learning at the University of Mumbai. Additionally I have worked on several interesting data science and computer vision projects mentioned below.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How would you define data science?  </p>
<p>Personally, I believe data science is extracting userful information and insights from a large collection of unstructured and uninformative data to make informed decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Describe a project youâ€™ve completed that required data analysis  </p>
<p>Recently, I worked on the following projects.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Predicting amazon product backorders .  <ul>
<li>The goal of this project was to determine whether a product would go on backorder or not.</li>
<li>There were two major issues with the dataset<ul>
<li>Target classes were imbalanced [98% samples belonged to 'no backorder']</li>
<li>Target classes were non-separable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I achieved 90% accuracy and 85% recall using the following techniques<ul>
<li>Non linear dimension reduction and visualization, support vector machines and gradient boosting ensemble learner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The model was designed in R.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>United States Presidential Elections- predicting voter preference<ul>
<li>The goal of this project was to determine individual's voting preference given his demographic information and his policy alignment.</li>
<li>I designed two ensemble learners, a gradient boosting model and a random forest model. The gradient boosting model achieved 90% accuracy on the test set.</li>
<li>The model was designed in R and the report was designed in Tableau</li>

<ul>
<li>Predicting unemployment rate using long short term memory recurrent neural networks<ul>
<li>The goal of this project was to predict unemployment rate in the United States.</li>
<li>The Gross Domestic Product time series followed an inverse time lagged relationship with the unemployment time series, thus the GDP series was used as the source series.</li>
<li>The model's biggest challenge was to adapt to the inconsistent oscillations in the target series.</li>
<li>My model achieved an RMSE error of less than 0.05 and did an excellent job in following the target series</li>
<li>The model was developed in python using keras deep learning repository with tensorflow backend</li>

<li>In what ways have you worked collaboratively with a team before?</li>
</ul>
<p>During my tenure as a Research Assistant, I worked with 2 fellow researchers. Our work ethic and collaboration lead to the project being completed well before its due date. Additionally, I served as the General Secretary of Computer Society of India, student chapter. Here I had the opportunity to lead a team of 16 people. My responsibilities included managing the daily activities of the chapter, organizing workshops, setting up assignments and deadlines for the team and ensuring that these were met. I am proud to have led the team to win the Best Student Chapter award in my tenure. I am currently leading the Association of Information Science and Technology chapter at Indiana University.</p>
